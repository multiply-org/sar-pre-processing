	abstract = {An empirical algorithm for the retrieval of soil moisture content and surface root mean square (RMS) height from remotely sensed radar data was developed using scatterometer data. The algorithm is optimized for bare surfaces and requires two copolarized channels at a frequency between 1.5 and 11 GHz. It gives best results for kh/spl les/2.5, /spl mu//sub /spl upsi///spl les/35\%, and /spl theta//spl ges/30/spl deg/. Omitting the usually weaker hv-polarized returns makes the algorithm less sensitive to system cross-talk and system noise, simplifies the calibration process and adds robustness to the algorithm in the presence of vegetation. However, inversion results indicate that significant amounts of vegetation (NDVI{\textgreater}0.4) cause the algorithm to underestimate soil moisture and overestimate RMS height. A simple criteria based on the /spl sigma//sub hv//sup 0///spl sigma//sub vv//sup 0/ ratio is developed to select the areas where the inversion is not impaired by the vegetation. The inversion accuracy is assessed on the original scatterometer data sets but also on several SAR data sets by comparing the derived soil moisture values with in-situ measurements collected over a variety of scenes between 1991 and 1994. Both spaceborne (SIR-C) and airborne (AIRSAR) data are used in the test. Over this large sample of conditions, the RMS error in the soil moisture estimate is found to be less than 4.2\% soil moisture.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Because the microwave dielectric constant of dry vegetative matter is much smaller (by an order of magnitude or more) than the dielectric constant of water, and because a vegetation canopy is usually composed of more than 99\% air by volume, it is proposed that the canopy can be modeled as a water cloud whose droplets are held in place by the vegetative matter. Such a model was developed assuming that the canopy “cloud” contains identical water droplets randomly distributed within the canopy. By integrating the scattering and attenuation cross-section contributions of N droplets per unit volume over the signal pathlength through the canopy, an expression was derived for the backscattering coefficient as a function of three target parameters: volumetric moisture content of the soil, volumetric water content of the vegetation, and plant height. Regression analysis of the model predictions against scattering data acquired over a period of four months at several angles of incidence (0°–70°) and frequencies (8–18 GHz) for HH and VV polarizations yields correlation coefficients that range from .7 to .99 depending on frequency, polarization, and crop type. The corresponding standard errors of estimate range from 1.1 to 2.6 dB.},

Based on knowledge of the scattering behavior in limiting cases and the experimental observations, an empirical model was developed for sigma degrees /sub hh/, sigma degrees /sub vv/, and sigma degrees /sub hv/ in terms of ks (where k=2 pi / lambda is the wave number and s is the rms height) and the relative dielectric constant of the soil surface.

For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites were generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization.},

The models are driven with field measurements acquired in 2017 at a test site near Munich, Germany. As vegetation descriptor for the canopy models Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used. The effect of empirical model parameters is evaluated in two different ways: (a) empirical model parameters are set as static throughout the whole time series of one growing season and (b) empirical model parameters describing the backscatter attenuation by the canopy are treated as non-static in time. The model results are compared to a dense Sentinel-1 C-band time series with observations every 1.5 days. The utilized Sentinel-1 time series comprises images acquired with different satellite acquisition geometries (different incidence and azimuth angles), which allows us to evaluate the model performance for different acquisition geometries. Results show that total LAI as vegetation descriptor in combination with static empirical parameters fit Sentinel-1 radar backscatter of wheat fields only sufficient within the first half of the vegetation period. With the saturation of LAI and/or canopy height of the wheat fields, the observed increase in Sentinel-1 radar backscatter cannot be modeled. Probable cause are effects of changes within the grains (both structure and water content per leaf area) and their influence on the backscatter. However, model results with LAI and non-static empirical parameters fit the Sentinel-1 data well for the entire vegetation period. Limitations regarding different satellite acquisition geometries become apparent for the second half of the vegetation period. The observed overall increase in backscatter can be modeled, but a trend mismatch between modeled and observed backscatter values of adjacent time points with different acquisition geometries is observed.},

We investigated and modeled the angular backscatter effect per land-cover class in three ScanSAR images of the Colombian Orinoco. We found that there is an evident effect of incidence angle on radar backscatter, depending on land-cover class, moisture content, and physical structure of the reflecting targets. To normalize the angular backscatter variation, we proposed two methods. The first one applies a cosine correction estimated through linear regression. The second one models the radar backscatter of flooded forest considering second-order signal interactions. The model explains the observed backscatter of flooded forest areas in the rainy season (R2 that is larger than 0.77).},

In a number of studies, the sensitivity of the ERS scatterometer to vegetation has been demonstrated, but it is not yet clear which vegetation parameters are of primary importance to explain the ERS scatterometer signal. In this paper, the effects of land cover and seasonal vegetation development are investigated by comparing ERS scatterometer data with land cover information, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data sets, and meteorological observations. As a study area, the Iberian Peninsula was chosen. The Iberian Peninsula is characterized by the Mediterranean climate that has a wet winter and a dry summer. This allows the authors to better differentiate the effects of the annual vegetation and precipitation cycle on the temporal evolution of the backscattering coefficient /spl sigma//spl deg/. It is shown that the ERS scatterometer has only limited capabilities for monitoring the vegetation development within a given year because most of the temporal variability of /spl sigma//spl deg/ is due to soil moisture changes. On the other hand, it might be of merit for vegetation discrimination on large scales (regional to global) because the percentage area of forests, bushes, and shrubs within one ERS scatterometer pixel is found to explain a significant part of the spatial variability of the signal.},

Instead, he constructs the concept of microwave remote sensing by comparing it to the process of audio perception, explaining the workings of the ear as a metaphor for microwave instrumentation. This volume takes an “application-driven” approach. Instead of describing the technology and then its uses, this textbook justifies the need for measurement then explains how microwave technology addresses this need. Following a brief summary of the field and a history of the use of microwaves, the book explores the physical properties of microwaves and the polarimetric properties of electromagnetic waves. It examines the interaction of microwaves with matter, analyzes passive atmospheric and passive surface measurements, and describes the operation of altimeters and scatterometers. The textbook concludes by explaining how high resolution images are created using radars, and how techniques of interferometry can be applied to both passive and active sensors.},
