	abstract = {An empirical algorithm for the retrieval of soil moisture content and surface root mean square (RMS) height from remotely sensed radar data was developed using scatterometer data. The algorithm is optimized for bare surfaces and requires two copolarized channels at a frequency between 1.5 and 11 GHz. It gives best results for kh/spl les/2.5, /spl mu//sub /spl upsi///spl les/35\%, and /spl theta//spl ges/30/spl deg/. Omitting the usually weaker hv-polarized returns makes the algorithm less sensitive to system cross-talk and system noise, simplifies the calibration process and adds robustness to the algorithm in the presence of vegetation. However, inversion results indicate that significant amounts of vegetation (NDVI{\textgreater}0.4) cause the algorithm to underestimate soil moisture and overestimate RMS height. A simple criteria based on the /spl sigma//sub hv//sup 0///spl sigma//sub vv//sup 0/ ratio is developed to select the areas where the inversion is not impaired by the vegetation. The inversion accuracy is assessed on the original scatterometer data sets but also on several SAR data sets by comparing the derived soil moisture values with in-situ measurements collected over a variety of scenes between 1991 and 1994. Both spaceborne (SIR-C) and airborne (AIRSAR) data are used in the test. Over this large sample of conditions, the RMS error in the soil moisture estimate is found to be less than 4.2\% soil moisture.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Because the microwave dielectric constant of dry vegetative matter is much smaller (by an order of magnitude or more) than the dielectric constant of water, and because a vegetation canopy is usually composed of more than 99\% air by volume, it is proposed that the canopy can be modeled as a water cloud whose droplets are held in place by the vegetative matter. Such a model was developed assuming that the canopy “cloud” contains identical water droplets randomly distributed within the canopy. By integrating the scattering and attenuation cross-section contributions of N droplets per unit volume over the signal pathlength through the canopy, an expression was derived for the backscattering coefficient as a function of three target parameters: volumetric moisture content of the soil, volumetric water content of the vegetation, and plant height. Regression analysis of the model predictions against scattering data acquired over a period of four months at several angles of incidence (0°–70°) and frequencies (8–18 GHz) for HH and VV polarizations yields correlation coefficients that range from .7 to .99 depending on frequency, polarization, and crop type. The corresponding standard errors of estimate range from 1.1 to 2.6 dB.},

For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites were generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization.},

The models are driven with field measurements acquired in 2017 at a test site near Munich, Germany. As vegetation descriptor for the canopy models Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used. The effect of empirical model parameters is evaluated in two different ways: (a) empirical model parameters are set as static throughout the whole time series of one growing season and (b) empirical model parameters describing the backscatter attenuation by the canopy are treated as non-static in time. The model results are compared to a dense Sentinel-1 C-band time series with observations every 1.5 days. The utilized Sentinel-1 time series comprises images acquired with different satellite acquisition geometries (different incidence and azimuth angles), which allows us to evaluate the model performance for different acquisition geometries. Results show that total LAI as vegetation descriptor in combination with static empirical parameters fit Sentinel-1 radar backscatter of wheat fields only sufficient within the first half of the vegetation period. With the saturation of LAI and/or canopy height of the wheat fields, the observed increase in Sentinel-1 radar backscatter cannot be modeled. Probable cause are effects of changes within the grains (both structure and water content per leaf area) and their influence on the backscatter. However, model results with LAI and non-static empirical parameters fit the Sentinel-1 data well for the entire vegetation period. Limitations regarding different satellite acquisition geometries become apparent for the second half of the vegetation period. The observed overall increase in backscatter can be modeled, but a trend mismatch between modeled and observed backscatter values of adjacent time points with different acquisition geometries is observed.},

We investigated and modeled the angular backscatter effect per land-cover class in three ScanSAR images of the Colombian Orinoco. We found that there is an evident effect of incidence angle on radar backscatter, depending on land-cover class, moisture content, and physical structure of the reflecting targets. To normalize the angular backscatter variation, we proposed two methods. The first one applies a cosine correction estimated through linear regression. The second one models the radar backscatter of flooded forest considering second-order signal interactions. The model explains the observed backscatter of flooded forest areas in the rainy season (R2 that is larger than 0.77).},

In a number of studies, the sensitivity of the ERS scatterometer to vegetation has been demonstrated, but it is not yet clear which vegetation parameters are of primary importance to explain the ERS scatterometer signal. In this paper, the effects of land cover and seasonal vegetation development are investigated by comparing ERS scatterometer data with land cover information, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data sets, and meteorological observations. As a study area, the Iberian Peninsula was chosen. The Iberian Peninsula is characterized by the Mediterranean climate that has a wet winter and a dry summer. This allows the authors to better differentiate the effects of the annual vegetation and precipitation cycle on the temporal evolution of the backscattering coefficient /spl sigma//spl deg/. It is shown that the ERS scatterometer has only limited capabilities for monitoring the vegetation development within a given year because most of the temporal variability of /spl sigma//spl deg/ is due to soil moisture changes. On the other hand, it might be of merit for vegetation discrimination on large scales (regional to global) because the percentage area of forests, bushes, and shrubs within one ERS scatterometer pixel is found to explain a significant part of the spatial variability of the signal.},

Instead, he constructs the concept of microwave remote sensing by comparing it to the process of audio perception, explaining the workings of the ear as a metaphor for microwave instrumentation. This volume takes an “application-driven” approach. Instead of describing the technology and then its uses, this textbook justifies the need for measurement then explains how microwave technology addresses this need. Following a brief summary of the field and a history of the use of microwaves, the book explores the physical properties of microwaves and the polarimetric properties of electromagnetic waves. It examines the interaction of microwaves with matter, analyzes passive atmospheric and passive surface measurements, and describes the operation of altimeters and scatterometers. The textbook concludes by explaining how high resolution images are created using radars, and how techniques of interferometry can be applied to both passive and active sensors.},

	abstract = {The GAMMA Modular SAR Processor (MSP), Interferometric SAR Processor (ISP), Differential Interferometry and Geocoding Software (DIFF\&GEO), and Land Application Tools (LAT) are modular software packages useful to process synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Data of both spaceborne and airborne sensors including ERS-1/2, JERS-1, SIRC, SEASAT, RADARSAT StripMap mode, and the single-pass Dornier DOSAR interferometer have been successfully processed interferometrically. State of the art algorithms have been implemented to achieve accurate processing of the data while permitting timely processing of large data sets. Recent projects completed with the software include generation of a continental scale mosaic of Siberia consisting of more 700 JERS scenes in the frame of the SIBERIA project and the generation of subsidence maps for Bologna, Abano, and Mexico City. User-friendly display tools and full documentation in HTML language complements the software. Both binary and source code licenses are available.},

	abstract = {First results using the new Sentinel-1 SAR look very promising but the special interferometric wide-swath data acquired in the TOPS mode makes InSAR processing more challenging than for normal stripmap mode data. The steep azimuth spectra ramp in each burst results in very stringent co-registration requirements. Combining the data of the individual bursts and sub-swaths into consistent mosaics requires careful “book-keeping” in the handling of the data and meta data and the large file sizes and high data throughputs require also a good performance. Considering these challenges good support from software is getting increasingly important. In this contribution we describe the Sentinel-1 support in the GAMMA Software, a high-level software package used by researchers, service providers and operational users in their SAR, InSAR, PSI and offset tracking work.},

	abstract = {The launch of recent satellite missions, the Sentinel fleet of the European Copernicus programme in particular, has led to a tremendous increase in available earth observation data provided at no cost. The increase in data availability opens new opportunities for analysing data not only in the spatial but also temporal domain by observing time series and thus the possibility to visualise processes on the earth's surface. Although this is not entirely new to optical satellite data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was only infrequently acquired in the past. With the new ESA SAR satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B there is now the possibility to observe the earth's surface with a repeat rate of up to six days and a spatial resolution of 10 m independent of atmospheric effects and sun illumination.
Together with the increase in data availability comes the challenge of organizing data and preparing it for scientific analysis. While traditional software aimed at analysing single images, the need arises for fully automated organization of large image archives with thousands of images together with a highly capable processing framework to make full use of available hardware resources.
The pyroSAR environment aims at providing a complete solution for the organization and processing of SAR satellite data for applications scalable from personal computers to large server infrastructures using only open source tools and libraries. Its purpose is to provide complex functionality for reading various data formats from past and present SAR satellite missions, handling metadata about acquisition characteristics in a database, and providing homogenised user-friendly access to processing utilities in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) as well as GAMMA Remote Sensing software. The individual processing steps are recorded in homogenized XML workflows so that a dataset is always annotated with information about its way from raw source to analysis ready format.
The data reader uses the Geo Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) where possible and own implementations otherwise. The metadata attributes are homogenised to enable database access of specific acquisition characteristics across different sensor platforms. The metadata is ingested into a database from which the original imagery can be selected for processing whilst keeping track of what had been processed before.
The SAR processor provides functionality to distribute the tasks across different computing cores as well as different server nodes. By following a stringent naming scheme for processed images as well as annotated metadata XMLs, processing can be organized to be performed by several operators in a server network. This way, redundant usage of disk space and processing resources can be reduced.
Once the images are processed, further functionalities are available for mosaicking and resampling images to common pixel boundaries suited for time series analysis or directly exporting the imagery to an Open Data Cube. 
The overall aim is thus to reduce the entire process of image processing to very few commands in order to achieve maximum usability. By simply providing a test site geometry, the type of data required and some additional parameters, like spatial resolution and time frame, all available raw SAR-data will be retrieved, pre-processed and exported to a selected format. Thus, the time needed for handling data and software, which could otherwise be spent directly on the analysis of data and development of algorithms to derive information from the data, is greatly reduced.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1919398V},
	abstract = {The Sentinel-1 Toolbox is a new open source software for scientific learning, research and exploitation of the large archives of Sentinel and heritage missions. The Toolbox is based on the proven BEAM/NEST architecture inheriting all current NEST functionality including multi-mission support for most civilian satellite SAR missions. The project is funded through ESA's Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM). The Sentinel-1 Toolbox will strive to serve the SEOM mandate by providing leading-edge software to the science and application users in support of ESA's operational SAR mission as well as by educating and growing a SAR user community. The Toolbox consists of a collection of processing tools, data product readers and writers and a display and analysis application. A common architecture for all Sentinel Toolboxes is being jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, Array Systems Computing and C-S called the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The SNAP architecture is ideal for Earth Observation processing and analysis due the following technological innovations: Extensibility, Portability, Modular Rich Client Platform, Generic EO Data Abstraction, Tiled Memory Management, and a Graph Processing Framework. The project has developed new tools for working with Sentinel-1 data in particular for working with the new Interferometric TOPSAR mode. TOPSAR Complex Coregistration and a complete Interferometric processing chain has been implemented for Sentinel-1 TOPSAR data. To accomplish this, a coregistration following the Spectral Diversity[4] method has been developed as well as special azimuth handling in the coherence, interferogram and spectral filter operators. The Toolbox includes reading of L0, L1 and L2 products in SAFE format, calibration and de-noising, slice product assembling, TOPSAR deburst and sub-swath merging, terrain flattening radiometric normalization, and visualization for L2 OCN products. The Toolbox also provides several new tools for exploitation of polarimetric data including speckle filters, decompositions, and classifiers. The Toolbox will also include tools for large data stacks, supervised and unsupervised classification, improved vector handling and change detection. Architectural improvements such as smart memory configuration, task queuing, and optimizations for complex data will provide better support and performance for very large products and stacks.In addition, a Cloud Exploitation Platform Extension (CEP) has been developed to add the capability to smoothly utilize a cloud computing platform where EO data repositories and high performance processing capabilities are available. The extension to the SENTINEL Application Platform would facilitate entry into cloud processing services for supporting bulk processing on high performance clusters. Since December 2016, the COMET-LiCS InSAR portal (http://comet.nerc.ac.uk/COMET-LiCS-portal/) has been live, delivering interferograms and coherence estimates over the entire Alpine-Himalayan belt. The portal already contains tens of thousands of products, which can be browsed in a user-friendly portal, and downloaded for free by the general public. For our processing, we use the facilities at the Climate and Environmental Monitoring from Space (CEMS). Here we have large storage and processing facilities to our disposal, and a complete duplicate of the Sentinel-1 archive is maintained. This greatly simplifies the infrastructure we had to develop for automated processing of large areas. Here we will give an overview of the current status of the processing system, as well as discuss future plans. We will cover the infrastructure we developed to automatically produce interferograms and its challenges, and the processing strategy for time series analysis. We will outline the objectives of the system in the near and distant future, and a roadmap for its continued development. Finally, we will highlight some of the scientific results and projects linked to the system.},
