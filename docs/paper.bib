  abstract = {The C-band Sentinel-1 satellite constellation enables the continuous monitoring of the Earth\&rsquo;s surface within short revisit times. Thus, it provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series data that can be used to detect changes over time regardless of daylight or weather conditions. Within this study, a time series classification approach is developed for the extraction of the flood extent with a focus on temporary flooded vegetation (TFV). This method is based on Sentinel-1 data, as well as auxiliary land cover information, and combines a pixel-based and an object-oriented approach. Multi-temporal characteristics and patterns are applied to generate novel times series features, which represent a basis for the developed approach. The method is tested on a study area in Namibia characterized by a large flood event in April 2017. Sentinel-1 times series were used for the period between September 2016 and July 2017. It is shown that the supplement of TFV areas to the temporary open water areas prevents the underestimation of the flood area, allowing the derivation of the entire flood extent. Furthermore, a quantitative evaluation of the generated flood mask was carried out using optical Sentinel-2 images, whereby it was shown that overall accuracy increased by 27\% after the inclusion of the TFV.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is particularly suitable for large-scale mapping of inundations, as this tool allows data acquisition regardless of illumination and weather conditions. Precise information about the flood extent is an essential foundation for local relief workers, decision-makers from crisis management authorities or insurance companies. In order to capture the full extent of the flood, open water and especially temporary flooded vegetation (TFV) areas have to be considered. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellite constellation enables the continuous monitoring of the earths surface with a short revisit time. In particular, the ability of S-1 data to penetrate the vegetation provides information about water areas underneath the vegetation. Different TFV types, such as high grassland/reed and forested areas, from independent study areas were analyzed to show both the potential and limitations of a developed SAR time series classification approach using S-1 data. In particular, the time series feature that would be most suitable for the extraction of the TFV for all study areas was investigated in order to demonstrate the potential of the time series approaches for transferability and thus for operational use. It is shown that the result is strongly influenced by the TFV type and by other environmental conditions. A quantitative evaluation of the generated inundation maps for the individual study areas is carried out by optical imagery. It shows that analyzed study areas have obtained Producer\&rsquo;s/User\&rsquo;s accuracy values for TFV between 28\% and 90\%/77\% and 97\% for pixel-based classification and between 6\% and 91\%/74\% and 92\% for object-based classification depending on the time series feature used. The analysis of the transferability for the time series approach showed that the time series feature based on VV (vertical/vertical) polarization is particularly suitable for deriving TFV types for different study areas and based on pixel elements is recommended for operational use.},

The models are driven with field measurements acquired in 2017 at a test site near Munich, Germany. As vegetation descriptor for the canopy models Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used. The effect of empirical model parameters is evaluated in two different ways: (a) empirical model parameters are set as static throughout the whole time series of one growing season and (b) empirical model parameters describing the backscatter attenuation by the canopy are treated as non-static in time. The model results are compared to a dense Sentinel-1 C-band time series with observations every 1.5 days. The utilized Sentinel-1 time series comprises images acquired with different satellite acquisition geometries (different incidence and azimuth angles), which allows us to evaluate the model performance for different acquisition geometries. Results show that total LAI as vegetation descriptor in combination with static empirical parameters fit Sentinel-1 radar backscatter of wheat fields only sufficient within the first half of the vegetation period. With the saturation of LAI and/or canopy height of the wheat fields, the observed increase in Sentinel-1 radar backscatter cannot be modeled. Probable cause are effects of changes within the grains (both structure and water content per leaf area) and their influence on the backscatter. However, model results with LAI and non-static empirical parameters fit the Sentinel-1 data well for the entire vegetation period. Limitations regarding different satellite acquisition geometries become apparent for the second half of the vegetation period. The observed overall increase in backscatter can be modeled, but a trend mismatch between modeled and observed backscatter values of adjacent time points with different acquisition geometries is observed.},

The steep azimuth spectra ramp in each burst results in very stringent co-registration requirements. Combining the data of the individual bursts and sub-swaths into consistent mosaics requires careful “book-keeping” in the handling of the data and meta data and the large file sizes and high data throughputs require also a good performance. Considering these challenges good support from software is getting increasingly important.

    abstract = {The launch of recent satellite missions, the Sentinel fleet of the European Copernicus programme in particular, has led to a tremendous increase in available earth observation data provided at no cost. The increase in data availability opens new opportunities for analysing data not only in the spatial but also temporal domain by observing time series and thus the possibility to visualise processes on the earth's surface. Although this is not entirely new to optical satellite data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was only infrequently acquired in the past. With the new ESA SAR satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B there is now the possibility to observe the earth's surface with a repeat rate of up to six days and a spatial resolution of 10 m independent of atmospheric effects and sun illumination.
Together with the increase in data availability comes the challenge of organizing data and preparing it for scientific analysis. While traditional software aimed at analysing single images, the need arises for fully automated organization of large image archives with thousands of images together with a highly capable processing framework to make full use of available hardware resources.
The pyroSAR environment aims at providing a complete solution for the organization and processing of SAR satellite data for applications scalable from personal computers to large server infrastructures using only open source tools and libraries. Its purpose is to provide complex functionality for reading various data formats from past and present SAR satellite missions, handling metadata about acquisition characteristics in a database, and providing homogenised user-friendly access to processing utilities in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) as well as GAMMA Remote Sensing software. The individual processing steps are recorded in homogenized XML workflows so that a dataset is always annotated with information about its way from raw source to analysis ready format.
The data reader uses the Geo Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) where possible and own implementations otherwise. The metadata attributes are homogenised to enable database access of specific acquisition characteristics across different sensor platforms. The metadata is ingested into a database from which the original imagery can be selected for processing whilst keeping track of what had been processed before.
The SAR processor provides functionality to distribute the tasks across different computing cores as well as different server nodes. By following a stringent naming scheme for processed images as well as annotated metadata XMLs, processing can be organized to be performed by several operators in a server network. This way, redundant usage of disk space and processing resources can be reduced.
Once the images are processed, further functionalities are available for mosaicking and resampling images to common pixel boundaries suited for time series analysis or directly exporting the imagery to an Open Data Cube.
The overall aim is thus to reduce the entire process of image processing to very few commands in order to achieve maximum usability. By simply providing a test site geometry, the type of data required and some additional parameters, like spatial resolution and time frame, all available raw SAR-data will be retrieved, pre-processed and exported to a selected format. Thus, the time needed for handling data and software, which could otherwise be spent directly on the analysis of data and development of algorithms to derive information from the data, is greatly reduced.},
